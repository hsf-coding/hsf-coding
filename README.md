## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**hsf-coding/hsf-coding** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studying on Fuzhou University. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ and Python
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: my email is: 2796608260@qq.com 

  I like to play table tennis, and sometimes I also play some competitive or exploratory games. Friends who have the same hobbies can communicate with each other. Of course, if you see my related articles, comments or this profile on this platform, you are welcome to exchange programming knowledge together.My programming ability is relatively general, and I hope to learn useful knowledge from competent strong people here >_<.
  My academic performance from primary school to high school was at the top of my class. However, after coming to Fuzhou University, I found that many people around me had better grades than me, which made me feel pressure but also motivation!
  I have not participated in any programming competition. Besides learning in class, I spent most of my time on self-study after class, searching for projects by myself to practice. Although I had many stumbles in the process and spent a lot of time, I gained some results. At present, I have mainly studied c and C ++ languages, and am learning ptyhon language. I am most interested in learning artificial intelligence, and I believe that exploring powerful artificial intelligence to improve programming efficiency is a trend of future development
  In the next three years, if the postgraduate entrance exams is successful, I will go to graduate school and continue to study in the field of IT. If I fail in postgraduate entrance exams, I will choose to get a job first.I hope I can find a job with a good salary in the future. While I am young, I can work hard and save money. At the same time, I can accumulate social experience and learn more skills, so as to lay a foundation for take the civil servant exam or the development of project manager in the future.
